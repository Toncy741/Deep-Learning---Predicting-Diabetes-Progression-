# Deep-Learning---Predicting-Diabetes-Progression-

* Objective:
* 
You are required to model the progression of diabetes using the available independent variables. This model will help healthcare professionals understand how different factors influence the progression of diabetes and potentially aid in designing better treatment plans and preventive measures. The model will provide insights into the dynamics of diabetes progression in patients.

* Dataset
Use the Diabetes dataset available in the sklearn library.



 1 Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gathered the dataset and performed necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, normalizing data, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

 2 Model Development:

Developed an initial neural network model with a simple architecture.
Trained the model using the training dataset and evaluated its performance on the test dataset.

3 Model Improvement:

Added an extra hidden layer to the model architecture to improve its learning capacity.
Used the Adam optimizer with a lower learning rate to enhance convergence.
Implemented early stopping to prevent overfitting during training.

4 Performance Evaluation:

Evaluated the improved model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.
Compared the performance of the improved model with the original model.

* Conclusion:
The improved model showed better performance compared to the original model. The Mean Squared Error was reduced, and the R² Score increased, indicating a better fit to the data. The addition of an extra hidden layer, the use of the Adam optimizer with a lower learning rate, and the implementation of early stopping contributed to these improvement
